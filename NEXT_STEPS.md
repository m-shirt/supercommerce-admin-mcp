# 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy to ChatGPT

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel is deploying automatically
- ✅ 130 API tools ready
- ✅ 2 interactive widgets built
- ✅ Full MCP protocol support
- ✅ Widget system integrated

## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Wait for Vercel Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

Find your `supercommerce-admin-mcp` project and wait for deployment to complete.

### 2. Check Environment Variables

**CRITICAL:** Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```
Settings → Environment Variables → Add:

SUPERCOMMERCE_BASE_URL = https://storeapi.el-dokan.com
SUPERCOMMERCE_API_API_KEY = your_jwt_bearer_token_here
```

If you just added them, click **Redeploy** to apply.

### 3. Get Your Production URL

Your Vercel project URL will be something like:
```
https://supercommerce-admin-mcp.vercel.app
```

Your ChatGPT MCP endpoint:
```
https://supercommerce-admin-mcp.vercel.app/api/mcp
```

### 4. Update Widget URLs (Important!)

Once you have your Vercel URL, run this script:

```bash
./scripts/update-widget-urls.sh https://YOUR-PROJECT.vercel.app
```

This will:
- Update widget asset URLs
- Rebuild widgets with correct paths
- Show you what to commit

Then:
```bash
git add build-widgets.mts assets/
git commit -m "chore: update widget URLs for production"
git push
```

### 5. Connect to ChatGPT

**Enable Developer Mode:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode
2. Follow the instructions to enable developer mode

**Add Your Connector:**
1. Open ChatGPT (web interface)
2. Settings → Connectors → Add Connector
3. Enter URL: `https://YOUR-PROJECT.vercel.app/api/mcp`
4. Click Connect

### 6. Test It!

Try these commands in ChatGPT:

```
"List all available inventories"
"Show me recent orders"
"Create a new product called Gaming Mouse with SKU MOUSE-001"
```

## 🎨 You'll See Interactive Widgets!

When you use `create_main_product` or `list_orders`, ChatGPT will display beautiful, interactive UI components instead of plain JSON!

## 📚 Documentation

- **`VERCEL_CHATGPT_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
- **`CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Full deployment documentation
- **`DEPLOYMENT_ACTIVE.md`** - Current status (ngrok - for testing)

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Update widget URLs for production
./scripts/update-widget-urls.sh https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app

# Rebuild widgets
npm run build:widgets

# Test locally
npm run start:http

# Serve widgets locally
npm run serve:widgets
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Widget assets** need the production URL update (step 4)
2. **Environment variables** must be set in Vercel
3. **Developer mode** must be enabled in OpenAI
4. **Widget rendering** won't work until URLs are updated

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Vercel deployment successful
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Widget URLs updated and redeployed
- [ ] ChatGPT connector added
- [ ] Can list tools in ChatGPT
- [ ] Widgets display correctly

## 🆘 Need Help?

Check the troubleshooting section in `VERCEL_CHATGPT_SETUP.md`

Common issues:
- "Connection failed" → Check environment variables
- "Cannot GET /api/mcp" → This is normal! MCP only accepts POST
- Widgets not showing → Update widget URLs and redeploy

---

**You're 90% there!** Just update the widget URLs once Vercel finishes deploying, and you'll have a fully functional ChatGPT app with 130 e-commerce tools and interactive widgets! 🎉
